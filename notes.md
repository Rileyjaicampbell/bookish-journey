meeting notes:
27 apr
- regeneration is fine, not need many tweets
- maybe one way to create feedback loop is to have a copy button and regenerate button which also serve as in context learning and which might later be used for finetuning
- maybe use user data for more context for the model
- maybe allowing user Tweet editing in UI could be helpful for further creating training example



Instruction for setting everything up:
- for Ross : pip freeze > requirements.txt to isolate python dependancies
- for Ross : add, commit and push to github
- for Matt and Riley: pull everything and then in the Tweet_generator folder type: pip install -r requirements.txt
- for Matt and Riley: open the tweet_client file, run all cells and then interact with the client
