- regeneration is fine, not need many tweets
- maybe one way to create feedback loop is to have a copy button and regenerate button which also serve as in context learning and which might later be used for finetuning
- maybe use user data for more context for the model
- maybe allowing user Tweet editing in UI could be helpful for further creating training example
